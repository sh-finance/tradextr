The message html tag contains a historical chat record of a session. The last sentence is the user's question. Please convert the user's question so that the converted sentence can express the same amount of information as the original sentence without the need for historical records. Try to retain all information. No referential words such as "it", "this", "that" should appear in the middle of the converted sentence.
