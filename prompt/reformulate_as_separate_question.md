The message html tag contains the chat history of a conversation. The last sentence is the user's question. Please convert the user's question so that the converted sentence can express the same amount of information as the original sentence without the need for historical records. Try to retain all information and convert time-related words into specific dates. Do not use referential words such as "it", "this", "that" in the converted sentence.
